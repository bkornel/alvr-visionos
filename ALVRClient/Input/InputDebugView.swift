//  There is no streaming desktop in the loop here: this opens the CoreBluetooth
//  driver, runs real snapshots through a real InteractionProfile, and lands them
//  in a DebugInputSink instead of the ALVR FFI. That makes the whole path —
//  driver, profile table, router — testable on device with nothing else running.
//
//  It deliberately shows *both* halves. The mapped column is what a server would
//  receive; the raw column is what the device actually reported. Without the
//  latter, everything the active profile drops on the floor (paddles, QAM, both
//  touchpads, grip capsense) would be invisible, and there would be no way to
//  tell "the driver never saw it" apart from "the profile doesn't bind it".
